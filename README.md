# An archive of my laughable high school AP Comp Sci class projects

### Cringe ahead warning:
Here lies an archive of Java projects from when I first took AP Computer Science back in high school.
Browse these files at your own peril, because believe me, they are quite laughable.

In one of these files, I even declared a top level variable called ```int i = 0```. Yes, I did the unthinkable.
